Prompt: Given a geometric sequence of positive terms {a_n} with the sum of the first n terms denoted by S_n, and the following equation: 2^10 S_30 + S_10 = (2^10 + 1) S_20. Determine the common ratio of the sequence {a_n}: (A) 1/8 (B) 1/4 (C) 1/2 (D) 1.
Finetuned Model Output: Given a geometric sequence of positive terms {a_n} with the sum of the first n terms denoted by S_n, and the following equation: 2^10 S_30 + S_10 = (2^10 + 1) S_20. Determine the common ratio of the sequence {a_n}: (A) 1/8 (B) 1/4 (C) 1/2 (D) 1.5 (E) 2
## Step 1: Recall the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence
The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula: S_n = a_1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a_1 is the first term and r is the common ratio.

## Step 2: Express S_10, S_20, and S_30 using the sum formula
We can express S_10, S_20, and S_30 using the sum formula as follows:
S_10 = a_1 * (1 - r^10) / (1 - r)
S_20 = a_1 * (1 - r^20) / (1 - r)
S_30 = a_1 * (1 - r^30) / (1 - r)

## Step 3: Substitute the expressions for S_10, S_20, and S_30 into the given equation
Substituting the expressions for S_10, S_20, and S_30 into the given equation, we get:
2^10 * a_1 * (1 - r^30) / (1 - r) + a_1 * (1 - r^10) / (1 - r) = (2^10 + 1) * a_1 * (1 - r^20) / (1 - r)

## Step 4: Factor out a_1 / (1 - r) from the equation
We can factor out a_1 / (1 - r) from the equation to get:
a_1 / (1 - r) * (2^10 * (1 - r^30) + (1 - r^10)) = a_1 / (1 - r) * ((2^10 + 1) * (1 - r^20))

## Step 5: Cancel out a_1 / (1 - r) from both

The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula: S_n = a_1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a_1 is the first term and r is the common ratio.

## Step 2: Apply the formula for S_10, S_20, and S_30.
Using the formula, we have: S_10 = a_1 * (1 - r^10) / (1 - r), S_20 = a_1 * (1 - r^20) / (1 - r), and S_30 = a_1 * (1 - r^30) / (1 - r).

## Step 3: Plug in the values for S_10, S_20, and S_30 into the given equation.
Substituting the values of S_10, S_20, and S_30 into the given equation yields: 2^10 a_1 * (1 - r^10) / (1 - r) + a_1 * (1 - r^10) / (1 - r) = (2^10 + 1) a_1 * (1 - r^20) / (1 - r).

## Step 4: Simplify the equation.
Simplifying the equation, we get: 2^10 * (1 - r^10) + (1 - r^10) = (2^10 + 1) * (1 - r^20).

## Step 5: Factor out (1 - r^10) from the equation.
Factoring out (1 - r^10), we have: (1 - r^10)(2^10 + 1) = (2^10 + 1)(1 - r^20).

Prompt: If the sum of two numbers is 15 and their product is 56, what are the two numbers?
Finetuned Model Output: If the sum of two numbers is 15 and their product is 56, what are the two numbers? If you're a math teacher, this is a great example of how to solve a system of equations. If you're a math student, this is a great example of how to apply the algebraic method to solve a system of equations. If you're a math enthusiast, this is a great example of how to use algebra to solve a system of equations.

## Step 1: Define the problem
We need to find two numbers whose sum is 15 and whose product is 56.

## Step 2: Set up the system of equations
Let the two numbers be x and y. The sum of the two numbers can be written as an equation: x + y = 15. The product of the two numbers can also be written as an equation: xy = 56.

## Step 3: Solve the first equation for x
We can solve the first equation for x: x = 15 - y.

## Step 4: Substitute x into the second equation
We can substitute x into the second equation: (15 - y)y = 56.

## Step 5: Expand and simplify the equation
Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get: 15y - y^2 = 56.

## Step 6: Rearrange the equation into standard form
Rearranging the equation into standard form, we get: y^2 - 15y + 56 = 0.

## Step 7: Factor the quadratic equation
Factoring the quadratic equation, we get: (y - 7)(y - 8) = 0.

## Step 8: Solve for y
Solving for y, we get: y = 7 or y = 8.

## Step 9: Solve for x
We can substitute y back into the equation x = 15 - y to solve for x. If y = 7, then x = 15 - 7 = 8. If y = 8, then x = 15 - 8 = 7.

## Step 10: Check the solutions
We can check our solutions by plugging them back into the original equations. If x = 7 and y = 8, then x + y = 7 + 8 = 15 and xy = 7 * 8 = 56. If x = 8 and y = 7, then x +
Original Model Output: If the sum of two numbers is 15 and their product is 56, what are the two numbers? If you're given the sum and product of two numbers, you can use the following system of equations to find them:
\[\begin{array}{l}x+y=15\\ xy=56\end{array}\]
The first equation is linear, and the second is quadratic. To solve this system, you can use either substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution, as it's the simpler of the two methods.
\[\begin{array}{l}x+y=15\\ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(x+y)=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(15)\\ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(x+y)=7.5\\ \end{array}\]
The equation \(x+y=15\) is linear, so you can use the distributive property to multiply both sides by \(\frac{1}{2}\). (This is the same as multiplying by 0.5, if you prefer decimals.)
\[\begin{array}{l}\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}y=7.5\\ \end{array}\]
This equation is now in the form \(y=mx+b\), where \(m=\frac{1}{2}\) and \(b=7.5\). The equation \(\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}y=7.5\) is in the form \(y=mx+b\), so you can use the slope-intercept form to graph it.
\[\begin{array}{l}y=\frac{1}{2}x+7.5\\ \end{array}\]
The graph of this line has a slope of \(\frac{1}{2}\) and a y-intercept of 7.5. To find the x-intercept, set \(y=0\) and solve for \(x\).
\[\begin{array}{l}0=\frac{1}{2}x+7.5\\ \end{array}\]
Subtracting 7.5 from both sides gives you \(-7.5=\frac{1}{2}x\). Multiplying both sides by 2 gives you \(-15=x\). The x-intercept is \(-15\).
\[\begin{array}{l}x+y=15\\ \

Original Model Output: What is the next number in the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,...? The sequence starts with two 1s, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
## Step 1: Recall the definition of the Fibonacci sequence.
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the addition of the last two numbers, usually starting with 1 and 1.

## Step 2: Identify the pattern in the Fibonacci sequence.
The pattern is such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, which means to find the next number in the sequence, we need to add the last two numbers.

## Step 3: Apply the pattern to find the next number in the sequence.
Given the sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, we need to add the last two numbers (8 and 5) to find the next number.

## Step 4: Calculate the next number in the sequence.
8 + 5 = 13.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$ ## Step 5: Verify the calculation by ensuring it follows the Fibonacci sequence pattern.
The new number (13) should be the sum of the two preceding numbers (5 and 8), which indeed it is. This confirms our calculation is correct.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$ ## Step 6: Understand that this step is more of a confirmation of the process rather than an addition to it.
This step is to reinforce the idea that the method used is correct, but it doesn't add any new information to the solution.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$ ## Step 7: Confirm the solution by ensuring it aligns with the Fibonacci sequence's characteristics.
Our calculation adheres to the Fibonacci sequence's rule of adding the two preceding numbers to get the next number, which is a fundamental property of the sequence.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$ ## Step 8: Provide a conclusion to the process.
We have correctly identified the next number in the Fibonacci sequence as 13, following the established rule of adding the two preceding numbers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$ ## Step 9: Finalize the solution by stating the answer.
The next number in the Fibonacci sequence after 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 is 13.

The final answer is: $\

Prompt: Solve the equation: log_2(x) + log_2(x - 3) = 3.
Finetuned Model Output: Solve the equation: log_2(x) + log_2(x - 3) = 3. (A) 9 (B) 15 (C) 27 (D) 63 (E) 81
## Step 1:  First, let's recall the logarithmic identity that states log_a(b) + log_a(c) = log_a(bc). This identity will be useful in simplifying the given equation.
## Step 2:  Applying the identity to the equation log_2(x) + log_2(x - 3) = 3, we can combine the logarithms into a single logarithm: log_2(x(x - 3)) = 3.
## Step 3:  To eliminate the logarithm, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form. Since the base of the logarithm is 2, we can rewrite the equation as 2^3 = x(x - 3).
## Step 4:  Simplifying the exponential expression, we get 8 = x(x - 3).
## Step 5:  Expanding the quadratic expression, we get 8 = x^2 - 3x.
## Step 6:  Rearranging the equation to standard quadratic form, we get x^2 - 3x - 8 = 0.
## Step 7:  Now, we need to solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 3x - 8 = 0. We can use the quadratic formula x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 1, b = -3, and c = -8.
## Step 8:  Plugging the values into the quadratic formula, we get x = (3 ± √((-3)^2 - 4(1)(-8))) / 2(1).
## Step 9:  Simplifying under the square root, we get x = (3 ± √(9 + 32)) / 2.
## Step 10:  Continuing to simplify, we get x = (3 ± √41) / 2.
## Step 11:  Since the quadratic equation x^2 - 3x - 8 = 0 has two solutions, we will have two values for x. However, we need to find the positive solution because the original equation involves log_2(x), which requires x to be positive.
## Step 12:
Original Model Output: Solve the equation: log_2(x) + log_2(x - 3) = 3. 3. Solve the equation: log_2(x) + log_2(x - 3) = 3. (A) x = 8 (B) x = 4 (C) x = 12 (D) x = 9 (E) x = 7
## Step 1:  We are given the equation log_2(x) + log_2(x - 3) = 3, and we need to solve for x.
## Step 2:  To simplify this equation, we can use the property of logarithms that states log_a(b) + log_a(c) = log_a(bc).
## Step 3:  Applying this property, we can rewrite the equation as log_2(x(x - 3)) = 3.
## Step 4:  Now, to eliminate the logarithm, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form: 2^3 = x(x - 3).
## Step 5:  This simplifies to 8 = x(x - 3).
## Step 6:  Expanding the right-hand side, we get 8 = x^2 - 3x.
## Step 7:  Rearranging the terms, we obtain the quadratic equation x^2 - 3x - 8 = 0.
## Step 8:  To solve for x, we can use the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a).
## Step 9:  Plugging in the values a = 1, b = -3, and c = -8, we get x = (3 ± √((-3)^2 - 4(1)(-8))) / (2(1)).
## Step 10:  This simplifies to x = (3 ± √(9 + 32)) / 2.
## Step 11:  Further simplifying, we get x = (3 ± √41) / 2.
## Step 12:  Since x must be positive, we discard the negative root and take the positive root, giving us x = (3 + √41) / 2.
## Step 13:  However, none of the answer choices match this value. We should instead look for the value that satisfies the original equation.
## Step 14:  To

Prompt: In a standard deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of drawing 2 aces in a row without replacement?
Finetuned Model Output: In a standard deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of drawing 2 aces in a row without replacement? This means that if the first card drawn is an ace, it is not replaced, and the same goes for the second card.
## Step 1: Identify the total number of aces in the deck
There are 4 aces in a standard deck of 52 cards.

## Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing an ace on the first draw
The probability of drawing an ace on the first draw is the number of aces divided by the total number of cards: 4/52.

## Step 3: Calculate the probability of drawing an ace on the second draw given that the first card drawn was an ace
After drawing an ace on the first draw, there are 3 aces left and a total of 51 cards left in the deck. Therefore, the probability of drawing an ace on the second draw is 3/51.

## Step 4: Calculate the overall probability of drawing 2 aces in a row without replacement
To find the overall probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities of the first and second draws together: (4/52) * (3/51).

## Step 5: Simplify the fraction if necessary
To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4. This gives us (1/13) * (3/51).

## Step 6: Perform the multiplication
We then multiply the fractions: (1/13) * (3/51) = 3/(13*51).

## Step 7: Simplify the fraction further if possible
We can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. This gives us 1/(13*17).

## Step 8: Perform the multiplication in the denominator
13*17 = 221.

## Step 9: Write the final fraction
The probability is 1/221.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{1}{221}}$
Original Model Output: In a standard deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of drawing 2 aces in a row without replacement? Since there are four aces in the deck, there are 51 cards remaining after the first ace is drawn.
Step 1: Determine the probability of drawing an ace on the first draw. There are 4 aces in a deck of 52 cards, so the probability of drawing an ace is 4/52.
Step 2: Determine the probability of drawing another ace on the second draw. After drawing an ace, there are 3 aces remaining in a deck of 51 cards, so the probability of drawing another ace is 3/51.
Step 3: Multiply the probabilities from steps 1 and 2 to find the overall probability of drawing two aces in a row without replacement.
